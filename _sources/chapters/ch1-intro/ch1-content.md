# Chapter 1. Introduction to Electrochemistry

Electrochemistry is a branch of chemistry that deals with reactions that, in addition to transforming chemical bonds, transfer electrical charge between reactants and products.  Much of electrochemistry is concerned with changes that occur due to passage of electical current, and the resulting conversions between electrical and chemical energy. The field is commonly invoked with regard to energy storage and conversion, but electrochemical phenomena play significant roles in a broad array of applications, ranging from chemical production, chemical sensors, corrosion, and others {cite:labelpar}`bard_text_2022` See [Chapter 2](chapters/ch2-devices-and-systems/ch2-content.md) for a broader discussion of electrochemical systems and applications.

Electrochemistry is a deep and complex field whose theory and practice spans more than a century.  A complete and thorough description of electrochemical theory is beyond the scope of this chapter. Rather, we aim to give an overview of the primary features of what makes an electrochemical reaction.  In subsequent chapters we will introduce concepts and theory as needed to model electrochemical phenomena. In order to cover a breadth of systems and phenomena, this presentation, at the moment, does not reflect the depth and complexity of electrochemical theory. In order to enable the engineering of electrochemical systems, we leave a full accounting of electrochemical science to the wealth of other wonderful texts which exist on the topic, and encourage the reader to avail themselves of these resources.{cite:labelpar}`bard_text_2022, fuller_text_2018, newman_text_2021`

## Electrochemical Reactions
Electrochemical reactions, also called _charge transfer reactions_, take place at the interface between two materials (_phases_). As the name implies, the reaction is considered a charge transfer reaction (and hence an electrochemical reaction) if electrical charge is transferred from one phase to another.

For example, consider the simple cartoon in {numref}`charge-transfer-fig`.

:name: charge-transfer-fig

Illustration of charge transfer at a phase boundary. On the left, a positively-charged lithium ion associates with a negatively-charged ion in the electrolyte to make a charge-neutral complex.  The electrochemical reaction moves the Li ion from the electrolyte to the electrode.  The reaction is influenced both by the chemical energy of the Li ion before and after the reaction and by the electric potential energy of the charge in each of the two phases. Shifts in either those energy forms can drive the reaction in the forward or backward direction.
