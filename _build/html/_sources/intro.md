# **_Modeling Electrochemical Systems:_ Introduction**

Steven C. DeCaluwe, Colorado School of Mines

## Goals and Scope

Welcome! The purpose of this book is to give a general overview of electrochemical systems and how to model them. In this book, we will cover:
- **Basics of electrochemistry**: electrochemical thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport,
- **Features of electrochemical systems**: electrodes, electrolytes, and balance-of-plant,
- **Electrochemical system operation**: use cases, operating modes,  how to evaluate performance, and
- **Electrochemical Modeling**: Building and using software tools to model electrochemical systems.

## What is Electrochemistry, and Why do We Care?

Electrochemistry can be thought of as a subset of chemistry, where chemical reactions are accompanied by the movement of charge between reactants and products. If the charge moves from one phase to another phase, the total electric potential energy of the system changes, during the course of the reaction. This has three practical implications of interest to us:
1. The potential energy of the various phases involved will influence the reaction rate, and can be varied to drive the reaction in one direction or another, 
2. The movement of charge results in an electrical current, which can be measured and therefore provides a measure of the reaction rate, and
2. The reaction can be used to either store or release electrical energy.

These three aspects of electrochemical reactions have led to the ubiquitous use of electrochemistry and electrochemical systems throughout society, for energy storage, conversion, and production, chemical processing, and sensors, among others. In recent years, advances in electrochemical systems (such as batteries) have led to a revolution in portable power for consumer devices and an explosion of electric mobility options. Moreover, the ability to couple efficient electrochemical storage solutions with intermittent renewable power sources (e.g. solar and wind) will have a significant impact on our attempts to decarbonize our energy supply chain and mitigate human impacts on Earth's climate and biodiversity. Beyond energy storage and conversion, electrochemical systems play an important role in a range of industrial chemical applications, as discussed in [Chapter 2](chapters/ch2-devices-and-systems/ch2-content.md). 

## Improving Electrochemical Systems

Improving electrochemical devices and systems is associated with a large array of benefits. These range from improved standards of living, abatement of anthropogenic climate effects and associated improvements in public health, and new classes of jobs and economic output, among others.  However, there are also numerous challenges that must also be managed, with risks that are associated with increasing use of electrochemical devices.  These include manging the extraction and supply chain for critical minerals (and associated social justice issues associated with potentially exploitative working conditions in mineral-rich regions of the world), device safety and durability, and new electrical infrastructure requirements. To leverage opportunities while mitigating risks, it is necessary that we develop a thorough and quantitative understanding electrochemical device operation. If we can understand and predict device performance for a variety of device designs, operating conditions, and applications, we can both develop improved devices and design electrochemical systems that build on their strengths.

## Numerical Modeling and Simulation

In this book, we use numerical simulations as a lens for understanding the performance of electrochemical systems. Performance is determined by a wide and interdiscplinary range of factors, including materials science, thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, fluid dynamics, and manufacturing. Numerical simulations provide us a framework in which we can describe these factors quantitatively, combining various phenomena so that we can predict the degree and ways in which each influences device and system performance.  

The book covers fundamental processes such as charge-transfer and chemical reactions, heat transfer, and species transport, describing equations to describe each process. These are then incorporated into the overall model via governing equations which describe the evolution of the _state_ of the device, given the processes modeled and the _boundary conditions_ of the device.

At present, this book presents models within a _one-dimensional_ _continuum_ framework.  To be sure, the state of the art in electrochemical modeling can typically include multi-scale simulations that include both nanometer-scale and device-scale effects. However, we limit the scope here with the aim of improving clarity and providing a basic understanding of electrochemical principles. We feel that these intermediate-scale models can be easily extended to incorporate lower-level calcultions, while also providing model outputs that can be coupled with system-level analysis. The book is not meant to be exhaustive--we refer to the great number of other wonderful texts on these topics, for readers interested in a deeper dive--but at the same time, it is not meant, necessarily, to be read cover-to-cover.  We aim to present significant depth on a range of topics relevant to electrochemical systems.  On any given topic, it is recommended only to the level of depth that suits your current interests.

## Beyond Model Development

As you will soon see, building numerical simulation tools is about much more than writing code.  In addition to defining the model scope and deriving governing equations, it is helpful to understand how electrochemical systems are built, operated, and assessed.  In this text, we will also therefore cover electrochemical system design and fabrication, electrochemical device operation and testing, and the characterization tools used to understand the evolution of the materials, interfaces, and structures involved in an electrochemical device during its lifetime.

## Software and this Text 

The models in this text are all developed using readily available, open-source [Python](http://python.org)-based software tools.  In all cases, we strive to give an introduction to some basic Python coding principles, tips and tricks, and approaches so that you can understand the code presented and build similar tools yourself.

This text is built using the [JupyterBook](http://jupyterbook.org) platform, which enables interactive code blocks intersperesed throughout the text.  For various examples, we will provide you with completed code blocks which you can execute/run _without having to leave this text_ and view the output.  For other cases, we will provide you with _incomplete_ code blocks, providing you and opportunity to write your own code in a supported manner, to gain practice and check your understanding. Wherever you see the {fa}`rocket` present at the top of a page, press {fa}`rocket`--> {guilabel}`Live Code` to enable interactive code blocks.
